The final product enabling CDN peering assists in coordinated and cooperative content delivery via internetworking among distinct CDNs to allow providers to rapidly “scale-out” to meet both flash crowds and anticipated increases in demand, and remove the need for a single CDN to provision resources.
An ad-hoc or planned peering of CDNs requires fundamental research to be undertaken to address the core problems of measuring and disseminating load information, performing request assignment and redirection, enabling content replication and determining appropriate compensation among participants on a geographically distributed “Internet” scale.
CDN peering allows different CDN providers to share resources in order to provide larger scale and/or reach to each participant than they could not achieve otherwise.
Peering allows a particular CDN to achieve larger scale/reach through resource sharing with other CDN(s).
The triggering condition must consider the expected and unexpected load increases in the initiating CDN.
negotiated relationships must specify the interactions among entities including service administration, coordination and disband (or re-arrangement) of internetworked CDNs.
Once the initiating CDN identifies its roles and activities through the created negotiated relationships for coordination and cooperation between CDNs, the next step is to choose potential CDNs to peer with.
The mediator instance passes the service requirements to the local PA to discover external resources from peers.
The PA performs the resource discovery process through predicting performance of the peers, working around issues of separate administration and limited information sharing among enlisted CDNs.
The System is to configure the ‘CDN peering’ protocols at the conduit of the respective CDNs in order to technically support the terms and policies implicitly specified through the negotiated relationships.
These protocols also allow participating CDNs to exchange information regarding the content availability and assists to redirect requests to an optimal peer.
Peering also enables the CDNs to exchange accounting information to perform billing based on the negotiated relationships.
The system do Development and validation of peering and manage the complexity of content delivery across Web servers of multiple CDNs that scale across the globe.
the system decrease cost of Web access, increase QoS through reduced latency, reduce server load, and bandwidth consumption (by a particular CDN server), thus improving the performance of content delivery.
The system assists an existing CDN to alleviate congestions by detecting and handling short-term load spikes (i.e. flash crowds) effectively.
The functions of the Web server(s) and its constituents is A Web server replicates content on-demand from the origin server and stores it for future use. 
The functions of the Web server(s) and its constituents is In the event of Web hotspot, it initiates request to trigger peering.
The functions of the Web server(s) and its constituents is The Web services host ensures the delivery of content to end-users based on the negotiated policies with other CDNs.
The functions of the Web server(s) and its constituents is The policy agent is responsible (in conjunction with the mediator) for determining which resources can be delegated and under what conditions (policies) delegation is permitted.
The functions of the Web server(s) and its constituents is The SLA-allocator performs the provisioning and reservation of Web server’s resources (e.g.CPU, bandwidth, storage etc.) to satisfy both local and delegated SLAs, and ensures that the terms of the SLAs are enforced.
The functions of the Web server(s) and its constituents is The Web servers’ underlying algorithms perform on-demand caching, content selection, and routing between servers.
The Mediator generates service requirements as the basis for negotiated relationships.
The Mediator passes the service requirements to the PA.
The Mediator works in conjunction with its local PA to discover external resources and to negotiate with other CDNs.
The Mediator ensures that the participating entities are able to adapt to changing circumstances (agility) and are able to achieve their objectives in a dynamic and uncertain environment (resilience).
Once a peering arrangement is established, it cont
rols what portion of the Web traffic (i.e.end-user requests) is redirected to the Web servers of the peering CDNs, which content is replicated there, how the replication decision is taken, and which replication policies are being used.
Service Registry encapsulates the resource and service information for each CDN.
Service Registry helps in discovering local resources through enabling the Web servers of CDN providers to register and publish their resource, service and policy details.
In the face of traffic surges, Service Registry supplies any necessary local resource information to the mediator.
When a new peering arrangement is established, an instance of the service registry is created that encapsulates all local and delegated external CDN resources.
Policy Repository virtualizes all of the policies within a peering arrangement including P WS , P M , and P Peering (i.e. Web server-specific policies, mediator policies, peering policies), along with any delegated policies for resources as a result of the peering arrangement.
Policy Repository provides a set of rules to the mediator to administer, manage, and control access to the resources in a peering arrangement.
Policy Repository returns existing peering policies to the PA during the establishment of long-term peering arrangements.
Peering Agent acts as a policy-driven resource discovery module for establishing negotiations.
Peering Agent exchanges policy, resource information, and service requirements with external PAs.
Peering Agent is used as a conduit by the mediator to establish negotiations with PAs of other peers and to acquire resources from them.
Content replication is performed using a cooperative pull-based approach where participating CDNs assist each others in serving data.
Load distribution is performed by measuring the load information and disseminating it within individual CDNs and amongst other CDNs using a hierarchical approach.
Request assignment and redirection is performed at multiple levels – at the DNS, at the gateways to local clusters, and also (redirection) between servers in a cluster.
Web Server publishes its resource and service information to the SR.
Service registry registers available local resources at the CDN provider and updates them.
